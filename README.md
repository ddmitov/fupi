Fupi is a serverless multilingual semantic search testbed and demo project based on [LanceDB](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb).  

Once upon a time in Kenya a giraffe calf was orphaned during a severe drought and was saved thanks to the kindness and efforts of a knowledgeable animal whisperer. He became so attached to his rescuer, that he often visited him long after he recuperated and was set free. You can read the story of Fupi [here](https://science.sandiegozoo.org/science-blog/lekiji-fupi-and-reteti) and [here](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jan/11/fupi-orphaned-giraffe-whisperer-ami-vitales-best-photograph).  
  
Today we use complex machine learning technologies thanks to the knowledge, persistence and efforts of many people. Just like the small Fupi, we should always be thankful to them! Their contributions are enormous!  

## Design Objectives

* **1. Multilingual semantic search, incl. ability to search using one language in texts of another language**  
* **2. Minimal or no dependency on GPUs, TPUs or other specialized hardware**  
* **3. No dependency on AI as a service (AIaaS) like OpenAI, Cohere etc.**
* **4. Serverless application model**
